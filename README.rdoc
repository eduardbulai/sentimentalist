Sentimentalist has been my central project as a rails developer apprentice at Launch Academy in Boston, MA.  This rails app functions as a sentiment analysis tool for companies and individuals.  With Sentimentalist, users can visualize the prevailing emotional currents across their Twitter networks utilizing a built-in natural language processor powered by the sad_panda ruby gem or a bayesian classifier that they train themselves.
