Sentimentalist has been my central project as a rails developer apprentice at Launch Academy in Boston, MA.  This rails app functions as a sentiment analysis tool for companies and individuals.  With Sentimentalist, users can visualize the prevailing emotional currents across their Twitter networks utilizing a built-in natural language processor powered by the sad_panda ruby gem (https://github.com/mattThousand/sad_panda) or a bayesian classifier that they train themselves.

In addition to functioning as a totally awesome tool for sentiment analysis, Sentimentalist also features a versioned API(http://www.sentimentalist.me/api/version1/sentiments).  Check out another github repository of mine, https://github.com/mattThousand/sentimentalist_ios_client_app, where I document my progress creating an iOS application to work with the Sentimentalist API.
