# 	As a user
# 	I want to view friends statuses within different time frames
# So that I can see a historical visualization of how my friends feel

# - When a user arrives at their homepage, they see tabs listing several time filters
# - When a user clicks on a time filter tab, the friend icon field in the center of their
# homepage refreshes to display only friends whose statuses have been updated within that timeframe
