# 	As a user
# 	I want to view sentiment information within different time frames
# So that I can see a historical visualization of how people are feeling

# - When a user arrives at the dashboard, they see tabs listing several time filters
# - When a user clicks on a time filter tab, the friend icon field in the center of their
# dashboard refreshes to display only friends whose statuses have been updated within that timeframe
# - Timeframes include ‘Today’, 7 Days’, 1 Month’, 1 Year’
