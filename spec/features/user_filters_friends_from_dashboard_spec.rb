# As a user
# 	I want to be able to view subsets of my friends
# 	So I can see how they are doing

# 	- When a user arrives at their homepage, they see a sidebar listing various groupings of
# their Facebook friends
# - When a user clicks on a group icon within the sidebar, the content of the central
# dashboard on their homepage refreshes to display only the icons of the friends contained within that specific group
