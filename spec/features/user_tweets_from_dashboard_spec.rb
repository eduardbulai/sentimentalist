# 	As a user
# 	I want to be able to tweet from my dashboard
# 	So that I can tell my friends how I feel

# 	- When a user is on their homepage, they see a text field in which they can input text
# - Below the text field, there is a submit button that, if clicked, submits text written in the text field to twitter and it appears on their twitter profile as a tweet
