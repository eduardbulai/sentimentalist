# 	As a user
# 	I want to be able to view geographical subsets of my followers
# 	So I can see how they are feeling

# 	- When a user arrives at their homepage, they see a sidebar listing the top 10 locations
#                where my followers are tweeting from
# - When a user clicks on a group icon within the sidebar, the content of the central
# dashboard on their homepage refreshes to display only the icons of the followers contained within that specific group
